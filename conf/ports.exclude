# Acceptable are:
# 1. single port numbers
# 2. port ranges (no spaces, e.g. 2048-4096)
# 3. program name patterns
# 4. port number or port range AND program name pattern separated by %, e.g.
# 1024-65535%ftp
# allows to avoid alerts being sent each time FTP opens port for data transfer.
#
# Program name patterns are checked against 'netstat -tulpn' output via Bash 
# match (=~) operator.
