### Application servers clusters
### Syntax:
### cluster|port|application|balance method
### Multiple clusters and ports should be put in quotes and separated by spaces:
### APP_SERVERS="cluster1|3000|app1|sticky cluster2|3000|app2| cluster2|3001|app3|sticky"
### or just use a file, like this:
### APP_SERVERS=`cat /path/to/my.apps.list`
### A file may contain one app record per line or one line of records separated
### by spaces, or both.
### This is the reason why the syntax is dumb (no port ranges etc): it makes
### it easier to generate this file dynamically via e.g. deployment system.
### For example, you change the number of workers (thin, uwsgi) in role.conf
### and easily get the according number of lines in the apps list file with
### different ports assigned to these workers.

APP_SERVERS=

# If balance method is empty in the apps list and BALANCE_METHOD below is empty
# too, it is effectively a round-robin method. The one defined below becomes the
# default for all balancers, but can be overwritten in the table. If any single
# record within some app in the list has balance method other than the default
# defined below, it overwrites it and applies it to this app balancer.
