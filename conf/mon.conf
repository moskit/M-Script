## IP address(es) to use for connection test. Multiple IPs should be separated 
## by space. If not set, defaults to the gateway and nameservers.
## If a ping response is received from either of IPs, test passes OK.
## Note that this test doesn't show if the server *is* disconnected, since if it
## really is, it can't send any alert. Use other servers (servers.mon.sh) or
## some external services for realtime connection test. But it's still useful,
## it shows if the server *was* disconnected and when.
## If nothing outside is pingable, use localhost. Practically, it disables the
## test, but it's a little bit better than just disabling it completely :)
