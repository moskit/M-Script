# Enables dashboard for higher level of cluster hierarchy. A special cluster

# The way dashboard gets data from other servers. It tries all available, but

# Number of ports/sockets monitor runs until the next ports/socket list update.
# In other words, you get this number of alerts about newly open or closed
