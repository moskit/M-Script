### main report and get alerts from. This monitor simply copies the content of
### report files of a standalone test to the main report file.
### Use comma or space as a separator.
### If full report is not wanted, use syntax foldername|grep, e.g.
### SATESTS="monitor1,monitor2|grep,..."
### Reports for monitors marked with '|grep' will be grepped for indicator lines
### (the ones with indicators <OK>, <*> etc.
