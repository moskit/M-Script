# Number of ports/sockets monitor runs until the next ports/socket list update.
# In other words, you get this number of alerts about newly open or closed
# listening ports/sockets. Then they are added to officially monitored.
# Set to 0 to disable automatic list update entirely (but remember that you
# will be getting alerts every FREQ seconds until you update the lists manually)

## IP address(es) to use for connection test. Multiple IPs should be separated 
## by space. If not set, defaults to the gateway and nameservers.
## If a ping response is received from either of IPs, test passes OK.
## Note that this test doesn't show if the server *is* disconnected, since if it
## really is, it can't send any alert. Use other servers (servers.mon.sh) or
## some external services for realtime connection test. But it's still useful,
## it shows if the server *was* disconnected and when.
## If nothing outside is pingable, use localhost.
