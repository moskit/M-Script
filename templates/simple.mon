### locking is recommended if you are not 100% sure that your monitor won't hang
### or take longer than FREQ
# get_lock

### time since the last run, if needed (timeshift is the average time needed
### for main process execution, it depends on the system speed and RUNDELAY
### setting
# timeshift=`cat /tmp/m_script/timeshift 2>/dev/null`
# [ -n "$FREQ" -a -n "$timeshift" ] && interval=$(($FREQ + $timeshift))
# [ -z $interval -a -n "$FREQ" ] && interval=$FREQ

### in case this monitor needs longer interval between runs
### interval can be anything that the 'date' utility can recognize
### (see 'man date' section DATE STRING)
# check_interval "5 min"

### in case you use check_period above and you need time since the last run:
# interval=`cat "$rpath/interval.tmp"`

### Here goes the monitor's logic

### results are in e.g. var1 (integer) and var2 (real)
# check_results var1|integer,var2|real # compares results with threshold in
                                       # $conf (see above) which should be of
                                       # form var1_1=<level1 threshold>
                                       # 3 levels are supported, from var1_1 to
                                       # var1_3
                                       
# store_results var1|integer,var2|real # stores results in database if needed

                                       # to have historic data, generate graphs
                                       # and so on)
