h1. Introduction

M-Script is, basically, a collection of shell scripts for various server management tasks. Each of the scripts can be run separately when/if needed, but bound together they form a well-integrated solution, still flexible because it is easy to combine/pipe/edit shell scripts to make them do exactly what you need.

It is based upon the main "Unix Way principles":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy :

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
* And, of course, the KISS(Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
